# Contacts list

*by Nicholas Neumann-Chun*

A contacts list -- i.e. address book -- that runs on a Node server. The user can:

- create new contacts (in a Bootstrap modal)
- update existing contacts (with the same modal)
- delete contacts
- sort the contacts by any of the data categories

These changes are reflected immediately in the client browser and are synced with the simple JSON database.
